Fishers and Nutters - Bumping and Grinding

This simulation is of agents gathering resources in a network of feeding sites.  The resources they gather turn to energy and with enough energy they can reproduce.  If they run out of energy they die.  Details of the model and results of the simulation can be found in our papers "Finding a mate with no social skills" from GECCO 2015 and "Emergence focused design in complex adaptive systems" from ECAL 2015.
